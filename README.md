# RubyConf Mini 2022 -- Crystal for Rubyists Workshop

An HTML version of the slide deck is included in this repo in [/slide_deck](/slide_deck).

The [Crystal Documentation](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/latest/) has links to a variety of books and references.

There is a more comprehensive summary of differences between Ruby and Crystal that can be found in the main [Crystal for Rubyists](https://crystal-lang.org/reference/1.6/crystal_for_rubyists/index.html) page.

Serdar Dogruyol has written a nice small book, [available online](https://www.crystalforrubyists.com/), on Crystal for Rubyists, as well.

The challenge task, implementing a die roller, can be found in [/eaba_roller](/eaba_roller).
